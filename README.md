Downstream and Upstream version support
---------------------------------------
Integration_tests was developed for the upstream MIQ community largely with contributions from Red Hat CloudForms quality engineers.

The master and downstream-stable branches of the integration_tests repository are written to always support MIQ 'master' branch builds.

Downstream CloudForms builds are supported by the framework as well, with a rolling window of active version support

Contributions to the master branch must support MIQ master and the following versions of Red Hat CloudForms:
- 5.11.z
