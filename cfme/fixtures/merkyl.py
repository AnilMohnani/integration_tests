        Note that this is a blocking call, ie, we ensure that the file
        is being logged by merkyl, before we continue. This is important
        and prevents the file_add operation being queued and processes

        in fact, nothing will be received.

        It is worth noting that the file path must be "discoverable" by merkyl.
        This may mean editing the allowed_files prior to deploying merkyl.
